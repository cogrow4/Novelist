# Multi-Platform Build System - Implementation Summary

## Overview

Your Novelist project now supports automatic builds for **11 different platform/architecture combinations**, up from the original 3. Every push to `main` or tagged release will automatically build binaries for all supported platforms.

## What Was Added

### 1. New Platform Support

#### Windows
- âœ… **Windows ARM64** (NSIS installer)
  - For devices like Surface Pro X and other Windows on ARM hardware
  - Uses NSIS installer format for better ARM compatibility

#### Linux
- âœ… **Linux ARM64** (AppImage, DEB, RPM)
  - For 64-bit ARM devices (Raspberry Pi 4/5, ARM servers)
- âœ… **Linux ARMv7l** (AppImage, DEB)
  - For 32-bit ARM devices (Raspberry Pi 2/3, older ARM boards)
- âœ… **Linux DEB packages** (x64, ARM64, ARMv7l)
  - Native packages for Debian/Ubuntu-based distributions
- âœ… **Linux RPM packages** (x64, ARM64)
  - Native packages for Fedora/RHEL/openSUSE-based distributions

## Build Matrix

| Platform | Architecture | Format | Job Name |
|----------|-------------|--------|----------|
| macOS | Universal (x64 + ARM64) | DMG | `build-macos` |
| Windows | x64 | MSI | `build-windows` |

**Total: 8 parallel build jobs â†’ 11 binary artifacts per release**

## NPM Scripts Added

```bash
npm run build:win:arm64      # Windows ARM64 NSIS installer
npm run build:linux:arm64    # Linux ARM64 AppImage
npm run build:linux:armv7l   # Linux ARMv7l AppImage
npm run build:linux:deb      # Linux DEB packages (all arches)
npm run build:linux:rpm      # Linux RPM packages (x64 + ARM64)
```

## Release Artifacts

Every release now includes:

```
Novelist-1.0.0-universal.dmg              # macOS Universal
Novelist-1.0.0-x64.msi                    # Windows x64
Novelist-1.0.0-arm64-Setup.exe            # Windows ARM64
Novelist-1.0.0-x64.AppImage               # Linux x64
Novelist-1.0.0-arm64.AppImage             # Linux ARM64
Novelist-1.0.0-armv7l.AppImage            # Linux ARMv7l
Novelist-1.0.0-x64.deb                    # Debian/Ubuntu x64
Novelist-1.0.0-arm64.deb                  # Debian/Ubuntu ARM64
Novelist-1.0.0-armv7l.deb                 # Debian/Ubuntu ARMv7l
Novelist-1.0.0-x64.rpm                    # Fedora/RHEL x64
Novelist-1.0.0-arm64.rpm                  # Fedora/RHEL ARM64
```

## How It Works

### Automatic "Latest" Releases
```bash
git push origin main
```
â†’ Triggers `.github/workflows/build.yml`
â†’ Builds all 11 binaries in parallel
â†’ Creates/updates "latest" release on GitHub
â†’ Uploads all artifacts

### Versioned Releases
```bash
npm run release:prepare 1.0.1
git push origin main
git push origin v1.0.1
```
â†’ Triggers `.github/workflows/release.yml`
â†’ Builds all 11 binaries in parallel
â†’ Creates versioned release (e.g., "Release v1.0.1")
â†’ Uploads all artifacts

## Architecture Notes

### Why These Platforms?

1. **Windows ARM64:** Growing market with Surface Pro X and upcoming ARM Windows devices
2. **Linux ARM64:** Raspberry Pi 4/5, ARM servers, and cloud ARM instances
3. **Linux ARMv7l:** Legacy ARM devices still widely used (Pi 2/3)
4. **DEB packages:** Native installation on Debian/Ubuntu (most popular Linux)
5. **RPM packages:** Native installation on Fedora/RHEL/openSUSE

### Cross-Compilation

All builds are **cross-compiled** on GitHub Actions runners:
- macOS builds run on `macos-latest`
- Windows builds run on `windows-latest`
- Linux builds run on `ubuntu-latest`

Electron Builder handles the cross-compilation automatically for ARM architectures.

## RISC-V and Other Architectures

**RISC-V** is not included because:
- Electron doesn't officially support RISC-V yet
- GitHub Actions doesn't provide RISC-V runners
- Would require custom cross-compilation setup

**Other architectures** not included:
- **32-bit x86:** Deprecated by Electron
- **PowerPC, MIPS, etc.:** Not supported by Electron
- **macOS ARM64 only:** Universal binary covers both architectures more efficiently

## Testing Recommendations

While all builds are automated, consider testing on actual hardware:

1. **Windows ARM64:** Test on Surface Pro X or ARM VM
2. **Linux ARM64:** Test on Raspberry Pi 4 or ARM server
3. **Linux ARMv7l:** Test on Raspberry Pi 3
4. **DEB/RPM packages:** Test installation on respective distros

## Troubleshooting

### Build failures
- Check GitHub Actions logs for specific job
- Verify `GH_TOKEN` secret is set
- Ensure all dependencies are compatible with target architecture

### Missing artifacts
- Verify artifact name patterns in workflow files
- Check build output paths match expected patterns
- Ensure electron-builder configuration is correct

### Platform-specific issues
- Review `PLATFORMS.md` for architecture details
- Check Electron documentation for platform support
- Verify electron-builder target configurations

## Performance Impact

**Build time:** Each workflow now runs 8 parallel jobs instead of 3
- Individual job times remain similar (~5-10 minutes each)
- Total workflow time increased minimally due to parallelization
- Artifact upload/download adds ~1-2 minutes

**Storage:** Each release now stores 11 binaries instead of 3
- Total release size: ~500MB-1GB depending on app size
- GitHub provides unlimited storage for public repositories

## Future Enhancements

Potential additions when technology supports them:

1. **RISC-V support** (when Electron adds support)
2. **Snap packages** for Linux (alternative to AppImage)
3. **Flatpak packages** for Linux (sandbox support)
4. **Windows Store package** (MSIX format)
5. **Mac App Store package** (pkg format)
6. **Auto-update support** (using electron-updater)

## Maintenance

To keep the build system healthy:

1. **Update dependencies regularly:**
   - `electron` and `electron-builder` versions
   - Node.js version in workflow files
   - GitHub Actions action versions (@v4, etc.)

2. **Monitor build success:**
   - Check GitHub Actions tab after each push
   - Review failed builds promptly
   - Keep GH_TOKEN secret valid and refreshed

3. **Test releases:**
   - Download and test binaries from actual releases
   - Verify checksums if implementing them
   - Collect user feedback on platform-specific issues

## Summary

Your Novelist app now has **comprehensive multi-platform support** with automatic builds for 11 different combinations. Users can download native installers for:
- Any modern Mac (Intel or Apple Silicon)
- Windows PCs (x64 or ARM64)
- Linux systems (x64, ARM64, or ARMv7l) with multiple package formats

Every commit to `main` automatically creates a "latest" release, and version tags create stable numbered releases. All of this happens automatically through GitHub Actions with no manual intervention required.

Happy building! ðŸš€
